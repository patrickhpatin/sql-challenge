# SQL Challenge
    
## Assumptions for the TA grading my assignment:

### 1. You are using a postgres database 11.0 or higher
### 2. Your database uses port 5432
### 3. You will need to edit the "databaseconfig.py" file with your connection information to test the bonus Jupyter Notebook
### 4. Because the PGAdmin SQL Tool sucks major donkey balls, there's no way to declare a variable for csv_path.  I tried
###     several different ways to no avail.  In addition, there is no way to use relative pathing to the csv files either.  
###     I tried several ways to do this as well to no avail. Due to this tool sucking so badly, you will need to change the path 
###     to the CSV files, for every csv file we import, to test the inport functionality.  I apologize but it's not my fault.


### One more thing... the above comments are no joke but still...
