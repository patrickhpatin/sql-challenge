# SQL Challenge
    
## Assumptions for the TA grading my assignment:

### 1. You are using a postgres database 11.0 or higher
### 2. Your database uses port 5432
### 3. You will need to edit the "databaseconfig.py" file with your connection information to test the bonus Jupyter Notebook
### 4. Because the PGAdmin SQL Tool sucks major donkey balls, there's no way to declare a variable for csv_path.  I tried several different ways to no avail.  In addition, there is no way to use relative pathing to the csv files either.  I tried several ways to do this as well to no avail. Due to this tool sucking so badly, you will need to change the path to the CSV files, for every csv file we import, to test the inport functionality.  I apologize but it's not my fault.
### 5. There's some abiguity to some of the questions in the SQL portion of this project such as: 3, 4, 6 and 7. I have interpreted these as asking to find all CURRENT employees. For example, #6 - List all emloyees in the Sales department (i.e. NOT all employees who have EVER BEEN in the sales department).  If an employee has a to_date in the past, that employee is NO LONGER in the sales department and therefore should NOT be in the list.


### And finally... the above comments are no joke but still...
